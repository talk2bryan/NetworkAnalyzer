# NetworkAnalyzer
This is a mobile Andrioid client application for generating network traffic and sending the data at intervals to a listening [server](https://github.com/talk2bryan/MasterNetworkAnalyzer).

As part of a cloud computing project, we are experimenting on an algorithm that decides when queries should be processed at the fog or a remote server level.
